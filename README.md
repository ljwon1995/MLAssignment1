1. Plot two clusters of points for training dateset

Generate two sets of separable random point clusters in R^2
Plot the point clusters in the training dataset using different colors depending on their labels


2. Plot two clusters of points for testing dataset

Generate two sets of separable random point clusters in R^2 for a testing dataset using the same centroid and the standard deviation of random generator as the training dataset
Plot the point clusters in the testing dataset using different colors depending on their labels (different colors from the training dataset)
